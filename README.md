## Issue in this repo.

#### Event Priority:  
The color display on the calendar based on event priority is not functioning correctly. This issue arises because I couldn't configure the color compatibility according to the FullCalendar plugin's requirements.

#### Day View for Users: 
the data was not getting fetch as i used the older version so may it could be the issue of version of older plugin
