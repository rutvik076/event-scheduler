##Issue in this repo.

Event Priority: The color display on the calendar based on event priority is not functioning correctly. This issue arises because I couldn't configure the color compatibility according to the FullCalendar plugin's requirements.

Day View for Users: the data was not getting fetch as i used the older version so may it could be the issue of version of older plugin
